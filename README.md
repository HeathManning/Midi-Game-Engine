# Midi-Game-Engine
A simple C++ class for creating animations or games on Novation's Launchpads or other midi controllers.

TODO:
- Fix timing
- Add support for arbitrary midi controllers
- Make commands device-dependant
- Cross platform?
Basically right now the engine only works for my specific midi controller in windows. The tasks above would generalise it to be more useful.
